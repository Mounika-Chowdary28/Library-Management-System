# Library-Management-System
This is the C programming project on Library Management System. It tells us the information about the books in the library.
This C program simulates a simple Library Management System. It allows users to perform essential library functions such as adding new books, displaying all books, searching for books by a specific author, and counting the total number of books in the library. The program uses structures to store book details and demonstrates the use of fundamental concepts in C programming, including loops, conditional statements, and user input/output.


**Features:**

Add Book Information: Enter details like book name, author, number of pages, and price.

Display Book Information: View the list of all books in the library.

Search by Author: List all books written by a specific author.

Count Books: Display the total number of books currently available.

Exit: Exit the program.

**Highlights:**

Implements data storage using a struct to hold book details.

Dynamic menu-driven interface for user interaction.

Practical use of functions like strcmp() for string comparison.

Scalable to manage up to 100 books in this version.
